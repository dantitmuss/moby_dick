      <strong>The Moby-Dick Bible</strong> is an experiment in reverent absurdity — a way of treating Herman Melville’s epic like a sacred text, full of strange truths and slippery meanings.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      A few years ago, I read <em>Moby-Dick</em> for the first time. It hit me harder than any classic ever had. Inside the novel was… everything.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      As someone who doesn’t believe in anything supernatural or divine, I’ve always been searching for a book that could serve as a kind of “guide.” Nathaniel Philbrick — a fellow <em>Moby-Dick</em> nerd who’s much smarter than I am, and author of <em>Why Read Moby-Dick</em> — once said:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="italic text-sm text-gray-300 pl-4 border-l-4 border-gray-500 mb-4">
      “For me <em>Moby-Dick</em> is really the American Bible. Embedded within it is the DNA of America’s culture.”
    </blockquote>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I took that literally. I broke it up into verses and started treating it like a sacred text.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The <em>Pequod</em> is a microcosm of the world itself, and now feels like the perfect time to look for meaning in its pages. Obsession, the search for meaning in an uncaring universe, a maniacal captain with a cult-like following that dooms the ship… it's wild that this was published in 1851. (Then again, once you read it, it becomes clear — because a lot of it is <em>really</em> old-timey.)

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How it Works</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      First, I split the entire novel into bite-sized “verses." That was a huge task. I wanted each verse to stand on its own, feel meaningful, and flow from one to the next — not too long, not too short. I used SpaCy, a Python library for natural language processing, to segment the text, and then manually fine-tuned each one.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Each verse is tagged with themes, vibes, and literary motifs. But the real magic happens in the semantic search. You can type anything — a question, a feeling, a phrase — and the site will generate a <em>Moby-Dick</em>-style verse from scratch using OpenAI’s GPT. That new verse is then compared to the real ones using FAISS, a vector similarity engine, which finds the most semantically similar passages.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Your input is used to generate a new verse in Melville’s style using an AI model.</li>
      <li>That verse is embedded and compared to all verses in <em>Moby-Dick</em>.</li>
      <li>The closest matches are returned — semantically, not literally.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Each verse in the Bible is embedded with 1538 dimensions for this comparison. The result is part scripture, part hallucination, and part literary concordance.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      This thing is far from perfect. But I hope it gives you something — a bit of guidance, reflection, or even just a weirdly specific quote for your moment.
